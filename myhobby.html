        <h3><li>Watching anime and reading manga</li></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Since grade school I always love watching anime. The first anime I watched was either 'Sailor-Moon' or Ghibli movies. I remembered that we used to watched animes with VHS and subtitle was not available that time so I had to watch it in Japanese langauge but I still love it and enjoyed it.
                        Until now it is still my favourite past-time and hobby whenever I wanna chill.
                    </li>
                    <li>I started reading manga since college. I watched One Piece anime before and I could no longer wait for the next episode so I started reading the manga since manga is more updated, since then, I finished so manga.</li>
